description: Though James Lane Allen's The Mettle of the Pasture is rife with the
  lush descriptions and strong sense of place that imbue his previous works, the central
  focus of this novel is on the complicated nuances of the blossoming love between
  protagonists Isabel and Rowan, proving that Allen is as skilled in creating unforgettable
  characters and dramatic tension as he is at depicting the contours of the natural
  landscape.
